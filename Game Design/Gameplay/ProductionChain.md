# Production Chain

## Overview
Farms produce raw materials, which are transported to factories for processing into finished goods. The player must optimize the flow of goods to meet customer demand efficiently.

## Components
- **Farms:** Produce raw materials at fixed rates.
- **Factories:** Convert raw materials into finished goods using recipes. Processing times and output depend on upgrades.
- **Store:** Receives finished goods for customer orders.

## Flow
1. Farms generate resources (e.g., wheat, milk).
2. Trucks pick up resources and deliver to factories.
3. Factories process resources into products (e.g., bread, cheese).
4. Trucks deliver finished goods to the store.

## Mobile Considerations
- Visual feedback for production and delivery.
- Tap to view production status or speed up processes (optional future feature).
