# Core Gameplay Loop

## Overview
The core gameplay loop of Farm Logistics Tycoon (Mobile) is designed for short, engaging sessions ideal for mobile play. Players build and optimize a logistics network to fulfill customer orders efficiently.

## Loop Steps
1. **Start Round:**
   - Player begins a timed round (3â€“7 minutes).
   - Map displays farms, factories, and store locations.
   - Player starts with limited money budget.
2. **Build & Upgrade:**
   - Player uses touch controls to build roads and connect nodes.
   - **Cost Management:** Each road tile costs money - players must choose routes carefully.
   - Upgrade trucks and expand fleet as money is earned from store sales.
3. **Order Fulfillment:**
   - Customers arrive at stores at random intervals and consume available stock.
   - Trucks automatically transport goods along built routes to restock stores.
   - Maintain adequate stock levels to satisfy customer demand and avoid rating penalties.
4. **Score & Progress:**
   - Successful customer service (stock available when customers arrive) increases store rating.
   - **Store Sales Generate Money:** Primary income source for road building.
   - Empty stock causing customers to leave reduces store rating and score.
   - Earnings can be reinvested in upgrades.
5. **End of Round:**
   - When timer ends, player receives summary of performance.
   - **Efficiency Rating:** Scored based on delivery speed, cost optimization, and profit margins.
   - Progress to next level or retry for better efficiency score.

## Primary Obstacles & Constraints
- **Resource Management:** Limited starting money forces strategic road building decisions
- **Route Optimization:** Balance between shortest (expensive) vs. affordable (longer) routes
- **Bankruptcy Risk:** Players can fail if they spend all money without generating sufficient income
- **Terrain Costs:** Different terrain types cost different amounts (flat land cheap, mountains/rivers expensive)

## Player Experience Goals
### What Players Should Feel:
- **Strategic Thinking:** "Should I build the direct expensive route or the cheaper winding path?"
- **Optimization Satisfaction:** "I found a clever route that saves money while staying efficient!"
- **Progressive Mastery:** "I can now see better solutions than my first attempts"
- **Replayability Drive:** "I want to get 3 stars on this level with a better strategy"

### Fun Factors:
- **Puzzle-Like Planning:** Each level is a logistics puzzle to solve optimally
- **Incremental Progress:** Watch your network grow and improve over time
- **Risk vs. Reward:** Take calculated risks with expensive routes for better efficiency
- **Creativity in Solutions:** Multiple valid approaches to the same logistics challenge
- **Satisfying Automation:** Once built, watch trucks efficiently deliver goods along your routes

## Key Mobile Considerations
- Short session length
- Touch-friendly controls
- Quick feedback and rewards
- **Efficiency-based scoring** encourages replaying levels
