# Customer & Scoring System

## Overview
Customers appear at the store with specific product requests and patience timers. Fulfilling orders quickly increases score and store rating.

## Mechanics
- **Customer Queue:** Customers line up with visible order requests and timers.
- **Order Fulfillment:** Deliver requested goods before timers expire for maximum points.
- **Scoring:** On-time deliveries earn points and stars; late/missed orders reduce score and stars.
- **Store Rating:** Affects customer flow and scoring multipliers.

## Mobile Considerations
- Large, clear order icons and timers
- Tap to view customer details
- Quick feedback for successful/failed deliveries
