# Traffic System

## Overview
Traffic adds a layer of strategy to logistics: road segments have limited capacity, and congestion can delay deliveries.

## Mechanics
- **Capacity:** Each road segment supports a limited number of trucks per time unit.
- **Congestion:** If too many trucks use a segment, they slow down, causing delivery delays.
- **Main Roads vs. Extensions:** Main roads have higher capacity; player-built roads are cheaper but more prone to congestion.
- **Bridges:** May have unique capacity or toll mechanics.
- **Upgrades:** Players can upgrade certain roads to increase capacity or reduce congestion (optional feature).

## Strategic Impact
- Players must plan routes to avoid bottlenecks.
- Encourages building alternate paths and timing deliveries.
- Traffic can be visualized with color-coded overlays or icons.

## UI/UX Considerations
- Show traffic levels on roads (e.g., green/yellow/red lines).
- Warn players of potential congestion when planning routes.
