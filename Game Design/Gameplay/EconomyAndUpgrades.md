# Economy & Upgrades

## Overview
Players earn money from successful customer service at stores, which can be reinvested into expanding and upgrading their logistics network.

## Mechanics
- **Earnings:** Each successful customer sale (when stock is available) adds to the player's money.
- **Revenue Source:** Artificial customers automatically purchase products from stores when stock is available.
- **Upgrades:** Money can be spent on new trucks, truck upgrades (speed/capacity), and road budget extensions.
- **Progression:** Upgrades unlock as the player advances through levels.

## Mobile Considerations
- Simple, touch-friendly upgrade menus
- Visual and audio feedback for purchases
- Optional in-app purchases for cosmetic upgrades (no pay-to-win)
