# Menus

## Overview
Menus provide navigation and access to game features outside the core gameplay loop.

## Main Menus
- Main menu (start, settings, credits)
- Level select
- Shop/upgrade menu
- Pause menu
- End-of-round summary

## Mobile Considerations
- Simple, uncluttered layouts
- Large buttons for easy tapping
- Quick transitions between menus
