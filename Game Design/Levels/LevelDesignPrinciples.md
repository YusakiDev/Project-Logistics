# Level Design Principles

## Overview
Levels are designed to gradually introduce new mechanics and increase in complexity.

## Principles
- Start simple, add complexity over time
- Introduce new product types and logistics challenges
- Vary map layouts and objectives
- Balance difficulty for short mobile sessions

## Hybrid Road System & Terrain
- Early levels: mostly pre-set main roads, simple buildable areas, minimal obstacles.
- Mid/late levels: introduce rivers (require bridges), unbuildable terrain (mountains, forests, water), and more complex buildable zones.
- Traffic and congestion become key challenges as levels progress.
- Use terrain and main roads to create unique puzzles and encourage creative solutions.
